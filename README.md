# notion-lookalike

A Kanban Board with visuals very similar to Notion.
Made using React + ScSS + Vite,

The application stores all entries in localStorage, so no requirement of a constant internet connection.

It is hosted [here](https://62d309000422273c71aa83d0--amazing-peony-cde31c.netlify.app/)

Clone the repo, and after installing using `npm install` , use `npm run dev` to run on localhost at port 3000
